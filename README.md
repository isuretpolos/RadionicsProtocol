# RadionicsProtocol
Open Source Standard Protocol for interchanging data and commands between Radionics Devices and other Hardware

I will write the concept for the protocol in the [Wiki](https://github.com/isuretpolos/RadionicsProtocol/wiki/The-Proof-of-Concept-for-0.1). If you want to discuss about features, format and applications, please visit the [community](https://vk.com/aetherone) on VK.com.
